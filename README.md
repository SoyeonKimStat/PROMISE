# PROMISE
PROMISE: Rcodes to run PROMISE (Prediction Oriented Marker Selection)

CVelastic: Cross validation to simultaneouly select alpha and lambda. This code is based on glmnet package.

Based on my paper below, PROMISE generally works better than CV to select regularization parameter(s) in the lasso and the elastic net
